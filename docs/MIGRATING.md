# Migrating docs for callers of the wasmvm Go project

## 1.x -> 2.0

- The `supportedCapabilities` argument in `NewVM` changed from a comma separated
  list to a list of type `[]string`.
- The field `CodeInfoResponse.Checksum` is now explicitly marked as
  non-optional. It has always been set to a 32 byte value in the past.
- All entrypoint functions now return the full result with an `Ok` or `Err`
  variant instead of just the data inside the `Ok`. This was previously only the
  case for `IBCPacketReceive`. It is important to note that this means contract
  errors are no longer returned in the `error` return value. Instead, the `Err`
  field should be checked for errors.
- The field `BlockInfo.Time` now uses a wrapper type `Uint64` instead of
  `uint64` to ensure string serialization. You can use `uint64(u)` to get the
  underlying value.
- The field `SubMsgResponse.MsgResponses` was added, mirroring the Cosmos SDK's
  version.
- CosmWasm gas values were reduced by a factor of 1000, so each instruction now
  consumes 150 CosmWasm gas instead of 150000. This should be taken into account
  when converting between CosmWasm gas and Cosmos SDK gas.
- A new lockfile called `exclusive.lock` in the base directory ensures that no
  two `VM` instances operate on the same directory in parallel. This was
  unsupported before already but now leads to an error early on. When doing
  parallel testing, use a different directory for each instance.
- `VM.StoreCode` now returns a `uint64` containing the gas cost in CosmWasm gas
  and takes a gas limit as argument. This was previously calculated in wasmd.
  The change brings consistency with the other functions that cause gas usage.

## Renamings

This section contains renamed symbols that do not require any further
explanation. Some of the new names may be available in 1.x already in cases
where the old name was deprecated.
